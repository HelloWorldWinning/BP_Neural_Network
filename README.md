# BP_Neural_Network
Neural Network of BP using numpy 

With the help of the numpy, I constructed a BP nerual network that consists of three hidden layers, which has 5, 4, 2 nodes respectively. The Iris dataset is used to train and test the Net, 80% of the data is for training ,the rest for testing. The result is promising.  On testing data , the precsion and recall of the Net are both 100%.
